# GenAI Blackjack Guide

This GenAI application built on the gemini API leverages gemini 1.5 flash and 1.5 pro. The Application takes an image of the game and a prompt as an input and then suggests the optimal
blackjack move to make based on information provided via RAG. When not provided with an image the application also answers general casino game related queries.

Depending on the complexity of the task requested by the user, Gemini 1.5 flash or 1.5 pro are used. This reduces the cost of the running the application.

The application was deployed through streamlit and can be accessed here:
